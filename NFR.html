<h2> Development Environment Requirments  </h2>
<p> 1) Eclipse IDE will be used for developing the HRMS web-based interface and its relation to  person database module.  Eclipse IDE  Eclipse is a multi-language software development environment comprising an integrated  development environment(IDE) and an extensible plug-in system. It is written mostly in Java  and can be used to develop applications in Java and, by means of various plug-ins, other  programming languages including Ada, C, C++, COBOL, Perl, PHP, Python, R,  Ruby(including on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, and Scheme. It can be used to  develop packages for the software Mathematica. The IDE is often called Eclipse JDT for  Java programming language, Eclipse ADT (Ada Development Toolkit) for Ada, Eclipse  CDT for C/C++, and Eclipse PDT for PHP.[4]  Eclipse is an open source community, whose projects are focused on building an open  development platform comprised of extensible frameworks, tools and runtimes for building,  deploying and managing software across the lifecycle. The Eclipse community is a not-for-profit,  corporation who are members of the Eclipse community hosts the Eclipse projects  and helps develop an open source community and an world of complementary products and  services.<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/">[5]</a> </p>
<p>2)  MySql Administrator or Microsoft SQL Server will be used to create, manage, and optimize  the person database module. MySql Administrator  MySQL is a relational database management system(RDBMS)[6] that runs as a server  providing multi-user access to a number of databases. The SQL phrase stands for Structured  Query Language.[7]  The MySQL development platform has made its source code available under the terms of  use of the GNU General Public License.  Open source free-software projects use MySQL if it is required a full-featured database  management system. Several paid editions are available for commercial use, and offer  additional functionality. MySQL is also used in may high-profile, large-scale World Wide  Web products, includeing Wikipedia, Goolge, Facebook, and Twitter.  </p>
<p>3)  Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database server, developed by Microsoft; it is a  software product whose primary function is to store and retrieve data as requested by other  software applications, be it those on the same computer or those running on another  computer across a network (including the Internet). There are at least a dozen different  editions of Microsoft SQL Server aimed at different audiences and for different workloads  (ranging from small applications that store and retrieve data on the same computer, to  millions of users and computers that access huge amounts of data from the Internet at the  same time). <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/sql-server/sql-server-2017">[8] </a></p>
